# Backgammon Setup

The indexing of the board is done from bottom-right to top-right in anti-clockwise direction. Black moves anti-clockwise while while moves clockwise. I feel this is important to explicitly state as there are different variations of the game.


# Input

There are 26 lines of input. The first 24 lines indicate the number of coins held by player 1 or player 2 at that particular point (long triangle). The next two lines indicate the roll of the die.
